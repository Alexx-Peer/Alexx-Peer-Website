## Description  
This About Me website is an educational portfolio-style class project built to showcase my skills in front-end development. Over the course of building this site, Iâ€™ve deepened my understanding of HTML, CSS, and responsive design. I practiced CSS animations, hover effects, embedded media like Google Maps and Youtube videos, and layout techniques. The project is fully responsive and includes fonts from Google, background texture, and interactive UI elements. I also experimented with typographic styling, layered elements using `z-index`, and visually polished features like a photo gallery with overlay captions.

This project also reflects some of my personal passionsâ€”like bartending, miniature painting, and trail bikingâ€”integrating both personal content and technical skill-building. Throughout the process, I also learned how to effectively use Git and GitHub for version control, and Netlify for site deployment.

Thank you to my professor Lynn Sichel
